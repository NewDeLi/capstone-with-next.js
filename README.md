## Welcome to my Capstone Project (neuefische Bootcamp)!

**Decisions - Vote with me** is a fullstack real-time app. It allows users to interact and vote in real time with others.
Each user can create a new question round, which others can join. In addition to that, each user can add his or her preferred options. The app shows all the different election results within an question round. They appear in a bar chart to ensure a clear overview for all the given options, which makes decisionmaking a lot easier.
